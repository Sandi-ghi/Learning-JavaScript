2. Determine if a Year is a Leap Year
   Write a program that:
   Takes a year (as a number) as input.
   Uses conditional statements to check whether the year is a leap year. (A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, unless it is divisible by 400.)
   Prints out whether the year is a leap year or not.
   Hint: Use the logical operators && (AND) and || (OR).

3. Identify the Day of the Week Using a Switch Statement
   Create a program that:
   Takes a number between 0 and 6 as input, where 0 corresponds to Sunday, 1 to Monday, and so on.
   Uses a switch statement to print the corresponding day of the week.
   Handles any number outside the range with a default message.


4. Even or Odd Checker with Ternary Operator
   Write a program that:
   Declares a variable with a numeric value.
   Uses a ternary operator to check if the number is even or odd.
   Assigns the result to another variable and prints the message.

5. Simple Calculator Using Conditional Statements
     
   Write a function calculate(num1, num2, operator) that:
   Takes two numbers (num1 and num2) and a string operator ("+", "-", "*", or "/").
   Uses if...else if...else statements to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the operator.
   Returns the result of the calculation.
   If an invalid operator is provided, return an error message.
